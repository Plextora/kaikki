Searching an app? Everyone now knows that. On Firefox? Everyone now knows that. Trying to uninstall Kaikki? (As you probably should) Everyone now knows that.

# Ok then, how do I install/use this?
Kaikki at the moment only works on Windows OS. You can download the .exe for Kaikki on the [release page](https://github.com/Plextora/kaikki/releases/latest)
